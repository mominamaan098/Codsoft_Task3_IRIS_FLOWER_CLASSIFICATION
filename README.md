# Codsoft_Task3_IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION
Iris Flower Classification
Project Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and is widely used for introductory classification tasks. This project demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to build a model that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers.

Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, with measurements of four features for each flower:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Each sample is labeled with one of the three species of Iris flowers:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

Usage
Start Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the iris_classification.ipynb notebook and run the cells to explore the dataset, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

Project Steps
Data Exploration: Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features if necessary.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model using various algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors).
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Selection: Choose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new Iris flower measurements.
Results
The final model achieves high accuracy in classifying the species of Iris flowers. Detailed evaluation metrics and confusion matrices are provided in the iris_classification.ipynb notebook.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a classification model using the Iris dataset. It covers data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The Iris dataset serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning classification tasks.
